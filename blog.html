                        <span>In JavaScript var, let and const are used to declere variables. But there are some major difference among them. let's discuss the metter,</span>

                        <h1 class="underline font-semibold text-lg">var</h1>
                        <p>1.before modern JS or ES-6 var was used to decler variables.</p>
                        <p>2.var is function-scoped.</p>
                        <p>3.If var declered outside a function then it become globally scopped, can be access the entire program.</p>
                        <p>4.Never abide by the law of block scope like let or const do.</p>
                        <p>5.var can be re-declered and re-asigned, He never minds.</p>
                        <p>6.if we declere a variable using var it become hoisted.</p>


                        <h1 class="font-semibold underline mt-5">let</h1>
                        <p>1.After ES-6 we are introduced with let.Like var let is also used to declere variables.</p>
                        <p>2.Variables declared with let are block-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined</p>
                        <p>3.We can't re-declere a variable using let but we can re-assign.</p>
                        <p>4.Variables declered using let will be never hoisted.</p>
                        <p>5.Accessing a let variable before its declaration will give an error.</p>

                        <h1 class="font-semibold underline mt-5">const</h1>
                        <p>1.Like var and let, const is used to declere variable.</p>
                        <p>2.Like let, Variables declared with const are block-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined</p>
                        <p>3.We can't re-declere and re-assign a variable using const.</p>
                        <p>4.Variables declered using const will be never hoisted.</p>
                        <p>5.Accessing a const variable before its declaration will give an error.</p>
                        <p>6.const is used to declare variables that should not be reassigned after their initial value is assigned</p>

                        <p>In JavaScript, null and undefined both are falsy value, that represent the absence of a value or the lack of a meaningful value, but they have some different use cases:</p>

                        <h1 class="underline font-semibold">null</h1>
                        <p>1.null is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.</p>
                        <p>2.It is often used when we want to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property should have no value or that it is empty.</p>
                        <p>3.We can assign null to a variable or an object property to indicate that it has no value.</p>

                        <h1 class="underline font-semibold mt-5">undefined</h1>
                        <p>1.undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of a value when a variable or object property has not been assigned a value.</p>
                        <p>2.It is often the default value of uninitialized variables and function parameters.</p>
                        <p>3.It can also be used to check if a variable has been defined or if a property exists in an object.</p>

                            REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is an architectural style and set of constraints for designing and interacting with web services. It is one of the most popular and widely used approaches for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) on the World Wide Web.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-2 font-semibold">For Example : we can compare API with an waiter in a restourant. If we want any item we call the waiter and as a response he goto the kitchen and bring the required item to us. Here we can compare the kitchen as the server where data is stored in. Like the waiter API bring us the required data in every call.</p>
